involta tech gems networking, jason murtz?

have to do virtual networking.
stalk the companies, kinda like their stuff, comment but not always.

don't just target recruiters target them all. churn rate, culture, etc.

developers, hey i noticed you've been a dev for x years can i pick your brain.

the students that continue to network and code are the students that find success always. don't get discouraged don't stop networking don't stop coding.

surgical approach is best but 
shotgunning still kinda works
follow up application's within 24hr
always end on a call to action - what are the next steps?

if you don't want job recommend other ppl

next checkpoint is getting a job
