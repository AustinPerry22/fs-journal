	.classname   makes a div with that class name
	Section.row.bg-prim#class(hello)   creates a section element with 2 classes and an id and the value hello
	* number adds that many in new lines

Span is an inline element to apply classes

Offset class counts as part of the 12 from columns without making a new column

Ps-number for padding inside collumn margin affects the whole row.

Align items up/down

Custom img class. Use height and vh for vertical height

Med- fidelity-  adding layout and images, buttons, etc.

High-fidelity- 


Mobile-first design makes it easier to fix problems that can occur.



Start html with low fidelity /container,column, row then go higher and higher

 use notes to indicate sections

Make sure to use google dev mode to see different styles

Margin on columns will make the row wrap

If you need a card/content put it in a div in the column. Make sure to add padding to the column to add space.

:root in css is basically global variables

Background posistion and size to manipulate background image

Buttons are inline elements

Backdrop filter add blur effect

Position absoulute, relative, etc.

Relative - is realtive to its parent

Absoulute - only cares about the document, doesn't have a parent
Top, bottom, left, right

To make an absoulute position relative to an element use position relative

Div relative            
     element  absoulute <- this will move based off of the div as long as relative is on it

@mediaquery   css    only apply whats inside,classes,stuff based off screen size.
