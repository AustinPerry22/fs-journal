# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorhpism are the the pillars of oop. Using these pillars allows us to write efficeint code.

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > Export differs from export default by allowing you to export multiple functions/variables from a file by name. Exporting default only allows you to export one function/variable from the module.

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > Encapsulation combines data and methods in an object. This is useful because the data/methods would only apply to the object you want it to.

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > The Proxy object allows use to change how we handle our objects. We can have the get/set methods do custom things based on what we want them to do. For instance we can throw errors if you try to set a variable to a string.

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > A class is a similar to a blueprint it shows what needs to be built. An instance of a class is like a house that is built from that blueprint.

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > A computed property is a property that needs to be evaluated. For example name: 'bob' is a property while name: myFunction('bob') is first computed.

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > The purpose of the MVC pattern is to organize your code effectively and have it be able to scale easily.

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > The controller is what manipulates data based on inputs and tells the view to update based on its calculations.

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > The job of the Services in MVC is to have a place where your business logic is seperated from the rest of the application.

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > The Model in MVC is the place where data is stored/represented.s
