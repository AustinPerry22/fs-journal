# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use git to push our code to a source control, so we can have multiple versions of a project.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > This is used to create a new folder/directory.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo-class is a selector that only applies to elements when they are in a certain state for example if you use the :hover pseudo-class then the pseudo-class only applies to the button when it is being hovered over. Some common ones I think I will use are :hover, :fullscreen, :enabled, :disabled, and :required.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity determines what properties to apply to an element if there are conflicting properties. It picks the highest value (usually the most specific) and applies those properties.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > If you over-utilize the !important feature it would override any styles you want applied to your elements. This would be difficult to apply styles to target multiple elements because your !important feature would override it.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Three components that make up a CSS rule are the selector, what the rule is targeting. The property, what thing you would like to change. The value is the last component this is what you assign the property to.  ex p{color: blue}  p would be the selector because it targets the p tags, color would be the property because it says to change the color, and blue would be the value because it is assigned to the property.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > I think good design can influence people by leaving an impression of wether the company/org is trustworthy/ up-to-date/ etc. Some things you can convey through design is the tone of the site, the accessability, and the flow/readability.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > The purpose of wireframing is to help convey ideas for a site, without needing to write out every detail. This can help save time and energy by having a design to work from. 

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I think that wireframes are usually worth the time and energy. If you are building a really basic site, then it probably isn't worth it, but otherwise I think having a wireframe could help you get a feel for the site without having to spend the time and energy coding it all.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > The display flex property is used in css to change how elements appear on the screen. With display: flex the elements can appear next to each other instead of above/below.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > The CSS properties that can affect the size of a box model are height and width. These properties change how large the box is.
