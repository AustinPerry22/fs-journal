# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I think being able to make a website that actually looks decent went pretty well, also I'm feeling pretty confident because it was all pretty easy. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I think understanding how display:flex works and how bootstrap uses it for columns and rows was suprising to me
because it was cool to see how bootstrap classes work and they aren't that complicated.
- What are you struggling with?
Driving to and from class.
- What would you count as a victory?
finishing my checkpoint and learning how to do mobile first design well.
